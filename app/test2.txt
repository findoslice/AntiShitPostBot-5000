Westminster is engulfed in a series of damaging claims by parliamentary researchers who produced a 'dirty dossier' of Tory MPs.

The list, seen by the Express & Star, makes a number of serious allegations – including one MP getting a former researcher pregnant who, it is claimed, was then 'made' to have an abortion.

But many of the entries appear to be consensual relationships with staff or fellow MPs.

South Staffordshire Conservative MP Gavin Williamson told the Express & Star that Prime Minister Theresa May believed any illegality should be raised with the police.

He said: "In any situation where someone has done anything that is wrong or illegal, this has to be reported to the police straight away – that's the view of the Prime Minister, I share that view, and I think everyone else does too.

"And that is the point that is so critical to emphasise throughout."

Parliamentary authorities are to draw up plans to allow victims of sexual harassment to report incidents 'without fear, following the abuse allegations.

Commons Speaker John Bercow met with senior parliamentary figures on the House of Commons Commission to plot a way forward as fresh claims of sexually intimidating behaviour emerged.

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has apologised for touching the knee of broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer at a dinner 15 years ago.

Ms Hartley-Brewer criticised 'wild rumours and claims' and said she was not a 'victim'.

Labour deputy leader and West Bromwich East MP Tom Watson has called for Parliament's regulator to agree to recognise trade unions, a move he says would better protect staff from sexual harassment.

The move came as a Cabinet Office investigation got under way into alleged misconduct by international trade minister and Mark Garnier, who is reported to have asked his Commons secretary to buy sex toys and called her 'sugar t**s'.

Theresa May's official spokesman earlier declined to confirm that the Prime Minister has full confidence in Mr Garnier, saying he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry.

The Conservative Wyre Forest MP has insisted that the incidents did not amount to harassment, describing the purchase of the vibrators as an instance of 'high jinks'.

Tory Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant said he fears a Westminster witch hunt, saying: "I feel there is a growing witch hunt mentality currently going on.

"We have got to ensure that inappropriate behaviour is stamped out. It's wrong. It's unprofessional.

"But, at the same time, we don't want to see individuals who have been blameless being accused of things which, maybe, they hadn't really done, or, maybe, at the time everyone was sloshed."
